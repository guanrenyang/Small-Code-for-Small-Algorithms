# Disjoint-Set
Aims to implement disjoint set in multiple languages

# TODO
- [x] Java
- [ ] cpp
- [ ] ...

- [ ] Increase the generalizability of the implementations.
# Attention
Current implementation uses a one-dimensional array, and the constructor needs to pass in the size of this array($n$). $n$ nodes are represented by $1,2,\cdots,n-1$
